## The Factory Method Pattern

- Defines an interface for creating an object , but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets
  a class defer instantiation to subclass.

## Design Principle

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
