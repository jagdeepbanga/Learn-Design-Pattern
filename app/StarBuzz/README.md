# StarBuzz Coffee App

Create a StarBuzz Coffee app to order with multiple options like

- Coffee (Dark Roast, Espresso, House Blend)
- Condiments (Mocha, Soy, Streamed Milk)

## Design Principle (The open closed principle)

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension, but close for modification.

## The Decorator Pattern

- Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
  subclassing for extending functionality.
