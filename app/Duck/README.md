# SimUDuck App

In Simulator Duck app have applied the Strategy Pattern.

## Design Principle

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.

## Strategy Pattern

- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes the interchangeable.
- Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
