# Weather Station App

Create a weather station app that provides three following display elements from given Weather data.

- current weather conditions
- weather statistics
- a simple forecast.

## The Observer Pattern

- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are
  notified and updated automatically.

## The power of loose coupling

- When two objects are loosely coupled. they can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other.
- The observer pattern provides an object design where subjects and observers are loosely coupled.

## Design Principle

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
